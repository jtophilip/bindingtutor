Documentation
-------------

If this is a binary release of MTBindingSim, you should
have a copy of the user's manual, in PDF format.  The

Installation
------------

 - Windows installer:

   Run the included Windows installer, which will install
   MTBindingSim and its dependencies.  If you have trouble
   getting MTBindingSim to run, make sure you are using
   the "full installer," not the "update installer."

 - Mac installer:

   First, install the MATLAB Compiler Runtime by 
   downloading it from the MTBindingSim website:

   Then, double-click the DMG file, and drag the app
   icon into your Applications folder.  To run, just
   double-click the MTBindingSim icon.

 - Source

   From source, you may either build a binary and run it,
   or you may run MTBindingSim directly in MATLAB by
   opening the file src/MTBindingSim.m.
