==================
Big Document Title
==================

You can get *italics*, and **bold** like this.  If you need to type some code
(i.e., in a monospaced font), type it ``like this`` (those are back-ticks, not
single quotes).

If you want to include a link, you can include one 
`by doing this <http://www.google.com/>`_.  Note that those are backtcks, and
then the URI in angle brackets, and an underscore after the closing backtick.

You can also put in footnotes.[#]_

.. [#] This is a footnote.  The hash makes it automatically number, so make
       sure the footnotes are in the same order as the footnote numbers.

You can make bulleted lists

- Very easily.
- Without much effort.
- Relatively simply.

--------------------

And numbered lists

1. Tend to work
2. In the same way
3. As bulleted lists.


You may include an image (located in the doc/wiki/images directory as a PNG) by
specifying:

  .. image:: $(IMAGES)/image
     :width: 3in
     :align: center

The $(IMAGES)/image construct will be turned into a URL to the .PNG file on
the wiki, and will embed the .PNG into the .PDF documentation in TeX.  The
width parameter is only used in the .PDF, so use something in inches that makes
sense for the TeX document.

You can make links to other parts of the documentation by using
`a version of the link syntax <$(DOCS):OperatingSystem>`_.

Inline math can be included in a run of text by using the "latex-math" command,
which looks like :latex-math:`\psi(r) = \exp(-2r)`.  Note that those are 
back-ticks around the math itself.  For a set-off equation, you can type:

  .. latex-math::
     
     a & = (x + y)^2 \\
       & = x^2 + 2xy + y^2
