============
Installation
============

MTBindingSim can be run in two ways. If you have MATLAB installed on your 
computer you can download the MatLab .m files and run MTBindingSim in MatLab.
If you do not have MATLAB you can download precompiled binaries and the
MATLAB Compiler Runtime and run MTBindingSim as an independent program.
The instructions below will tell you how to download and run MTBindingSim
in both ways.

MTBindingSim Binaries
=====================

This section tells you how to download and run the MTBindingSim binariries
using the MATLAB Compiler Runtime.

Before you begin, you need to know which operating system (Mac OS X or Windows)
you would like to run MTBindingSim in and whether you have a 32 or 64 bit
operating system. If you are not sure whether you have a 32 or 64 bit operating
system, go to <$(DOCS):OperatingSystem>`_ and follow the directions to determine
which version you have.

Downloads
---------

You will need to download both the MATLAB Compiler Runtime and the MTBindingSim
binaries for your operating system from the `MTBidingSim download page
<http://code.google.com/p/mtbindingsim/downloads/list>`_.

Installation
------------

First, you need to install the MATLAB Compiler Runtime. On Windows, double
click the MCRinstaller.exe file to run the intsaller. On Mac, open the
.dmg and open the installer package.

Next, install MTBindingSim. First double click the .zip file to open it.
