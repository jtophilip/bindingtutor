Troubleshooting

Installation
============

MTBindingSim Doesn't Run
------------------------

Make sure that you have downloaded and installed the MatLab Compiler 
Runtime and the Visual C Runtime (if you're running Windows). If you're 
not sure whether you've downloaded and installed these two programs, 
download them from our downloads page (insert link) and run them again.

Graphing
========

My Graph Doesn't Show Up
------------------------

If you graph multiple simulations on the same graph the axes will be set 
to show the full range of all curves. If you have curves with very 
different values you may not be able to see all of the curves on the 
same graph. Try closing the graph and making a new graph, paying 
attention to the range of the x- and y-axis.
