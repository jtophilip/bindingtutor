<!-- WARNING: This page is specifically referenced in the MTBindingSim documentation, do not remove it without updating the Troubleshooting section of the docs! -->

MTBindingSim uses the Google Code issue-tracking system to keep track of bug reports, feature requests, and requests for support.

## Should I file a support ticket?

You should file a support ticket if you're in any one of these situations:

  1. You've found a bug in MTBindingSim.
  2. MTBindingSim has produced an incorrect graph.
  3. You have an idea for a feature you would like MTBindingSim to include.
  4. You have a question or a problem that's not answered by our documentation, and would like a response from a developer.

Any other kinds of communication should be [sent to the developers by e-mail](${DOCS}:ContactUs).  If you do meet one of the above criteria, however, please do not e-mail the developers -- a support ticket is by far the most efficient way for your problem to be dealt with.

Also, before you begin, [browse the list of all tickets](http://code.google.com/p/mtbindingsim/issues/list) to make sure that no one else has submitted the same issue.

### Google Accounts

If you do want to submit a support ticket, you will need to sign in with a Google Account.  You may already have one -- if you have a GMail account, a Google Reader account, etc., or if your institution uses Google Apps to provide its e-mail, any of these accounts will work for logging into Google Code.

If you don't have a Google Account, you may [create a new Google Account](https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount).  It's fast, free, and easy.  If you'd rather not, you may still [send the developers an e-mail,](${DOCS}:ContactUs) although this will delay our response.

## Tickets

### Bug reports / Incorrect graphs

While we've done all we can to make sure that MTBindingSim is bug-free, nobody's perfect.  To submit a bug report or to let us know about an incorrect graph, please follow these steps.

  1. First, can you reproduce the bug?  Try closing out MTBindingSim and duplicating the exact series of steps which caused the bug.  If you can get the bug to occur more than once, it's probably our fault.  If not, you may submit a ticket anyway, but there is little chance the developers will be able to assist you.
  2. Once you have a set of steps that can cause the bug, [enter a new ticket.](http://code.google.com/p/mtbindingsim/issues/entry)  Under "Template," select "Bug report."
  3. It is *vital* that you complete all the information in this window in order for us to be able to help you.  Enter a one-line summary of the bug, then let us know what went wrong and what should have happened instead.  Enter the steps which you found will reproduce the bug, and finally tell us your operating system (Windows, Mac, or other, and 32- or 64-bit) and version of MTBindingSim.
  4. Click "Submit Issue," and we'll contact you when we have a fix for your problem!


### Feature requests

If you've got an idea for a feature which should be included in MTBindingSim, we'd love to hear it.  Just [enter a new ticket,](http://code.google.com/p/mtbindingsim/issues/entry) select "Feature request" under "Template," and fill out the appropriate information.  We can't guarantee we'll follow up, but if it seems like a good idea, we'll do our best.


### Support requests

If you have a question or a problem that's not been covered by our documentation, or you want to know how to do something special with MTBindingSim, you may always submit a support request and we'll do our best to contact you with a response.

Before you submit a support request, be certain that you've read all the appropriate sections of the MTBindingSim documentation.

If you still need help, [enter a new ticket,](http://code.google.com/p/mtbindingsim/issues/entry) select "Support request" under "Template," and fill in the details.  We'll do our best to contact you with assistance.


## After you file a ticket

The link to your ticket, which will look like <http://code.google.com/p/mtbindingsim/issues/detail?id=5> (with a different ID number at the end, of course), is a permanent link, and you may visit it to keep track of our progress.  Note that you may choose to be e-mailed when the issue changes, by "starring" it (click the star to the left of the "Issue X" text at the top of the page).

We attempt to process tickets as quickly as we can, though more difficult requests may take some time.
