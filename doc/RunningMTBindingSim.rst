====================
Running MTBindingSim
====================

To plot a graph using MTBindingSim, select the plotting options and binding model you would
like to use, enter the parameters you want, and click the graph button. This section explains
what plotting options and bindinding models are availible. The plotting options are `Experimental
Method`_, `Plotting Mode`_, `X-axis`_, and `Number of Points`_. The avalible binding models are
`First Order Binding`_, `Traditonal Cooperativity`_, `Seam and Lattice Binding`_, `MAPs Bind
MT-bound MAPs`_, `2MAPs Bind MT-bound MAPs`_, and `MAPs Dimerize`_.

Plotting Options
================

There are serveral sets of plotting options that can be selected. These options will apply to all
graphed curves.

Experimental Method
-------------------

There are three avalible experimental methods. Curves from different experimental methods
cannot be plotted on the same graph, so changing the experimental method will automatically
close an active graph.

**Vary [MT]**

In this method, the concentration of A is held constant and the concentration of MT is varied.
The fraction of A bound is graphed on the y-axis. This is a "standard" binding experiment
and simulates data from many standard experimental methods of measuring biding data,
including SPR, fluorescence anisotropy, and tryptophan fluorescence, as well as cosedimentation
assays.

**Vary [A]**

In this method the concentration of MT is held constant and the concentration of A is varied.
The concentration of A bound is graphed on the y-axis. This kind of data cannot be collected using
many standard binding assays such as SPR and fluorescence anisotropy, but it can be collected
using a cosedimentation assay.

**Competition**

In this method there are two MT binding proteins, A and B. The concentration of A and the
concentration of MT are held constant while the concentration of B is varied. The fraction of A
bound is plotted on the y-axis. This kind of data can be collected with many standard methods
of measuring binding data, such as SPR, fluorescence anisotropy, tryptophan fluorescence, and
cosedimentation assays.
