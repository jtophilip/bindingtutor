Running MTBindingSim for the First Time
=======================================

Download the version of MTBindingSim for your operating system from our Downloads Page (put
a link here). Double click MTBindingSim to open it. You should see a window that looks
like this:

Put in a screen shot of MTBindingSim when first opened.

The defaults are to plot a graph in vary [MT] mode with the X-axis as [MT] total and the
binding model as first order binding. See (section) for an explanation of the plotting
options and (section) for the availibile binding models.

To begin, enter values for the [MT] range

and the values for [A] total, K_D, and the binding ratio.

To calculate the binding curve under these conditions, click the graph button.

A graph that looks like this will pop up

Congradulations, you've just plotted your first binding curve using MTBindingSim.

Try changing the values of [A] total, K_D, or the binding ratio to see how the curves change.
After plotting four curves you'll have a graph that looks like this

If you want to know how to edit and save the graph, please see (section).

If you'd like to start over with a new graph, click the clear button. This will
delete the current graph and subsequent curves will be plotted on a new graph.

See (Running MTBindingSim) and (How To) for more information about the options
and capabilities of MTBindingSim. If you have any problems, see (TroubleShooting).
