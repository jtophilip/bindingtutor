=================================
Determining Your Operating System
=================================

MTBindingSim is available as a precompiled binary for four different
operating systems: Windows and Mac OS X, in 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
If you download one of these precompiled binaries, you do not need to 
have MATLAB installed on your computer in order to run MTBindingSim.

You will, however, need to determine whether your operating system is
32-bit or 64-bit.  Follow the directions below appropriate to your 
platform.

Windows

First, you will need to open the System control panel.  On Windows XP,
open the Control Panel, then click "Performance and Maintenance," and
finally "System."  On Windows Vista and Windows 7, open the Control
Panel, click "System and Maintenance" (on Vista) or "System and Security"
(on Win7), and then click "System."

Now you need to see whether your operating system is 32-bit or 64-bit.
On Windows XP, click the "General" tab, and look for the information
about your version of Windows XP.  You will see either "Windows XP
Professional Version X", or "Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Version
X."  If you see "x64 Edition," you have 64-bit Windows.  Otherwise, and
if you are unsure, you have 32-bit Windows.

On Windows Vista and Windows 7, look for the "System type:" line under
"System."  It will either say "32-bit Operating System" or "64-bit
Operating System."

`Files for 32-bit Windows <http://code.google.com/p/mtbindingsim/downloads/list?q=OpSys-Windows>`_ 
are tagged with ``OpSys-Windows`` in the MTBindingSim downloads.  `Files
for 64-bit Windows <http://code.google.com/p/mtbindingsim/downloads/list?q=OpSys-Windows64>`_
are tagged with ``OpSys-Windows64``.

Mac OS X
--------

Under Mac OS X, click the Apple Menu, and then select "About This Mac."
First, check the version number, right underneath the "Mac OS X" text.
If you are using Mac OS X 10.5 or newer, continue reading.  If not, you
have 32-bit Mac OS X.

Now, look for the "Processor" line.  If you have either an "Intel Core 2
Duo" or an "Intel Xeon", then you have a 64-bit Mac.  Otherwise, you have
a 32-bit Mac.

Note that all currently-shipping Macintosh computers are 64-bit capable.
