This chapter explains how to use some of the advanced features of 
MTBindingSim. You will learn `Saving Graphs`_, `Editing Graphs`_, and 
`Running Comparisions`_.

Editing and Saving Graphs
=========================

Saving Graphs
-------------

To save a graph generated by MTBindingSim for later use or editing, 
either select Save from the File menu or click the save icon in the menu 
bar. You can save your figure in the following formats:

- MATLAB figure (.fig)
- Adobe Illustrator file (.ai)
- EPS file (.eps)
- JPEG image (.jpg)
- Paintbrush 24-bit file (.pcx)
- Portable Bitmap file (.pbm)
- Portable Document Format (.pdf)
- Portable Graymap file (.pgm)
- Portable Network Graphis file (.png)
- Portable Pixmap file (.ppm)
- Portable inKmap file (.pkm)
- TIFF image (.tif)
- TIFF image no compression (.tif)

Once saved, your figure can be opened with the appropriate program for 
editing or use in a paper or presentation.


Editing Graphs
--------------

The graphs generated by MTBindingSim can be edited in several ways. From 
inside the program you can change the location of the legend box by 
clicking and draggin. You also can edit the legend text by doulbe 
clicking on it.

If you would like to see a particular part of the graph blown up you can 
use the zoom in and out tools on the graph window and then the hand tool 
to drag the graph to the desired region.

More extensive editing can be done by saving the graph as a MATLAB .fig 
file or an Adobe Illustrator file (.ai). If you have MATLAB you can then 
open the .fig file and edit it using all the MATLAB figure editing 
tools. Adobe Illustrtor files can be edited by opening them in 
Illustrator and editing them as you would any other file.

Running Comparisions
====================

To compare two curves in MTBindingSim, first select "compare two curves" 
from the plotting mode box.

   :width: 5in
   :align: center

This will cause a second model selection drop down box and model 
parameter input boxes to appear.

Enter the parameters for the curves you wish to compare in the two 
columns. The curves are independent of each other. An exmaple of two 
curves to be compared is below.

   :width: 5in
   :align: center

When you click the graph button the curves will be plotted on the active 
graph or a new graphs.

.. image:: $(IMAGES)/howto-2curves
   :width: 5in
   :align: center

The program also will calculate the difference between the two curves 
and display the result if the X-axis is plotting total [MT] or total [A] 
or in competition mode.

   :width: 5in
   :align: center

These values are calcualted by computing the absolute and percentage 
difference between the curves at each point. Both the average difference 
and the point of largest difference are reported for absolute and 
percentage difference. This feature is designed to help researchers 
determine whether the predicted differences between two curves are 
measurable given their expected experimental error.
