Editing and Saving Graphs
=========================

Saving Graphs
-------------

To save a graph generated by MTBindingSim for later use or editing, 
either select Save from the File menu or click the save icon in the 
toolbar. You can save your figure in the following formats:

- MATLAB figure (.fig)
- Adobe Illustrator file (.ai)
- EPS file (.eps)
- JPEG image (.jpg)
- PCX file (.pcx)
- Portable Bitmap file (.pbm)
- Portable Document Format (.pdf)
- Portable Graymap file (.pgm)
- Portable Network Graphics file (.png)
- Portable Pixmap file (.ppm)
- Portable inKmap file (.pkm)
- TIFF image (.tif)

If you wish to embed your figure in a PowerPoint presentation or a Word 
document, the best choice is probably a JPEG image.  If you wish to 
include your figure in a LaTeX document, you should probably save it 
either as a PDF file or as an EPS file.  Finally, if you wish to edit 
the graph, changing text or other graph properties, it is recommended to 
save the graph either in Adobe Illustrator format (if you have access to 
Illustrator), or in PNG format (for editing in any image editing 
software, including Photoshop).


Editing Graphs
--------------

The graphs generated by MTBindingSim can be edited in several ways. From 
inside the program, you can change the location of the legend box by 
clicking and dragging. You also can edit the legend text by 
double-clicking on it.

If you would like to see a particular part of the graph blown up, you can 
use the zoom in and out tools on the graph window, and then the hand tool 
to drag the graph to the desired region.

To edit the graph more extensively, two options are available. If you 
have MATLAB, you can save the graph as a MATLAB Figure (.FIG) file, and 
edit it as you would any other MATLAB graph. Otherwise, it is 
recommended to save as an Adobe Illustrator (.AI) file, and edit in 
Adobe Illustrator.  You may also be able to edit an Illustrator file in 
the open-source `Inkscape <http://www.inkscape.org/>`_ image editor.


Running Comparisions
====================

To compare two curves in MTBindingSim, first select "compare two curves" 
from the plotting mode box.

   :width: 5in
   :align: center

This will cause a second model selection drop down box and set of model 
parameter input boxes to appear.

Enter the parameters for the curves you wish to compare in the two 
columns. The curves are independent of each other. An exmaple of two 
curves to be compared is below.

.. image:: $(IMAGES)/howto-enter2
   :width: 5in
   :align: center

When you click the graph button, the curves will be plotted on the active 
graph or a new graph.

.. image:: $(IMAGES)/howto-2curves
   :width: 5in
   :align: center

If the X-axis is plotting total [MT] or total [A], 
or in competition mode he program also will calculate the difference between the two curves 
and display the result,.

   :width: 5in
   :align: center

These values are calculated by computing the absolute and percentage 
difference between the curves at each point, and both the average and 
largest difference are reported for each. This feature is designed to 
help researchers determine whether the predicted differences between two 
curves are detectable given their expected experimental error.
