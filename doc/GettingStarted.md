# Getting Started

Thanks for checking out BindingTutor! Here's a quick-start tutorial designed to get you graphing binding curves in no time.

## Running BindingTutor for the First Time

To begin, you will need to [download and install BindingTutor](http://bindingtutor.org/bindingtutor). When you run BindingTutor for the first time, you should see a window that looks like this:

![image](${IMAGES}/gettingstarted-open){width=5.127in align=center}

BindingTutor's defaults are to plot a graph of an experiment in which the total concentration of ligand, [L], is varied (along the X-axis), and the binding model is first-order binding. See [the Running BindingTutor chapter](${DOCS}:RunningBindingTutor) for more information about these settings, and the [Binding Model Mathematics chapter](${DOCS}:BindingModels) for more detailed information about the binding models.

First, enter values for the experimental range of [L]. Varying between 0 and 10 is a nice start.

You will also need to enter values for [P] total and K~D~. Try 2 for both [P] total and K~D~.

![image](${IMAGES}/gettingstarted-parameters){width=1.24in align=center}

To calculate the binding curve under these conditions, click the graph button.

![image](${IMAGES}/gettingstarted-graphbutton){width=0.687in align=center}

You should now see a graph that looks like this:

![image](${IMAGES}/gettingstarted-graph1){width=4.047in align=center}

Congratulations, you've just plotted your first binding curve using BindingTutor!

Try changing the values of [P] total or K~D~ to see how the curves change. After plotting four curves you'll have a graph that might look something like this:

![image](${IMAGES}/gettingstarted-4curves){width=4.407in align=center}

If you'd like to start over with a new graph, click the clear button. This will delete the current graph, and subsequent curves will be plotted on a new plot.

For more detailed information about what you can do with BindingTutor, see the [Running BindingTutor](${DOCS}:RunningBindingTutor) and [How To...](${DOCS}:HowTo) chapters. If you have any trouble, see the [Troubleshooting](${DOCS}:Troubleshooting) section.

Good luck, and happy graphing!
