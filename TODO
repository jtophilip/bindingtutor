TODO for v1.0:

 * write code to graph second curve

 * write code to calculate differences and display them

 * test Tau binding/number of binding sites model--is the model in the paper 
the same as ours if you divide Kd by n?
   * change solver programs to accept n OR
   * write a model to simulate using their equation

 * write model for 2 MAPs bind MT-bound MAP
