TODO for v1.0:

* Move validation code for input boxes on curve 2 to before the actual plot() call
  for curve 1.

* Remove the get(handles.labelX_Y) calls from the validation code, hard-code those
  values in the strings.

* Remove the "this curve is X" color label and setting code.

* Change solver programs to accept n by multiplying MTtot and n

* Change program to accept X axis as free or total for both experimental modes

* Add competition experimental mode

* Write model for 2 MAPs bind MT-bound MAP
