* Version 0.11 [beta]

** Added back a new pseudo-cooperativity model.

** Added a new two-sites binding model.


* Version 0.10 [beta]

** Removed cooperativity binding mode.

** Added Scatchard plotting.


* Version 0.9 [beta]

** Updated calculation of binding ratio, this parameter now works differently.

** New interface to save graphs and data.


* Version 0.8.1 [beta]

** Fixed an urgent calculation bug.


* Version 0.8 [beta]

** Changed terminology for dissociation constants.

** Bug fixes, including a calculation error corrected.


* Version 0.7 [beta]

** Complete documentation

** Various bug fixes


* Version 0.6.1 [beta]

** Various bug fixes


* Version 0.6 [beta]

** Various bug fixes

** Inputs now default to 0 when the experimental mode or model is changed. The 
ratio always defaults to 1.

** Added a new model where protein A can bind to MT either as a monomer or as a
dimer with different affinities.


* Version 0.5 [beta]

** Currently supported binding models:

*** First order binding of microtubule binding proteins to microtubules

*** "Classical" cooperativity

*** A model where a protein binds the microtuble at the seam and the lattice 
with different affinities.

*** A model where a microtubule binding protein can bind either the microtubule
or a microtubule bound protein, allowing two total layers of microtubule 
bound proteins.

*** A model where a microtubule binding protein can bind either the 
microtubule or a microtubule bound protein, allowing up to three layers 
of microtubule binding proteins on the microtubule.

** Three different modes of collecting binding data:

*** Holding the protein of interest constant and varying the microtubule
concentration

*** Holding the microtubule concentration constant and varying the 
concentration of the protein of interest

*** An experiment with two different microtubule binding proteins where 
one microtubule binding protein and microtubule concentration are held 
constant and the concentration of the other microtubule binding protein 
is varied. In this mode both microtubule binding proteins are assumed to 
follow first order binding.
