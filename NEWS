* Version 0.5 [beta]

** Currently supported binding models:

*** Simple binding of two molecules binding each other

*** "Classical" cooperativity

*** A model where a protein binds the microtuble at the seam and the lattice 
with different affinities

*** A model where a microtubule binding protein can bind either the microtubule
or a microtubule bound protein.

** Two different modes of collecting binding data:

*** Golding the protein of interest constant and varying the microtubule
concentration

*** Holding the microtubule concentration constant and varying the 
concentration of the protein of interest.
